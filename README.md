Minesweeper is my own version of the classic videogame.

Player is allowed to select the amount of rows and columns to buid his/her very own board. Also level selection is allowed:

•easy - 10% of board tiles are mines

•medium - 25% of board tiles are mines

•hard - 50% of board tiles are mines

The goal is to mark all the hidden mines on the board using the space bar.



GOOD LUCK



Minesweeper was built using html, CSS, JavaScrip and Jquery.
